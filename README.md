NeoPixel LEDs that respond to motion &amp; flow. Warning: can be addictive.

NeoPixell LEDS that have three setting (party, chill, and motion controlled) that toggles when power is cycled. The motion controlled setting uses a GY-521 MPU-6050 MPU6050 3 Axis Accelerometer Gyroscope Module with 6 DOF sense motion. Currenlty only responding on two planes of motion. Hoping to get around to changing that sooner than later. 

I also hope to uplaod a schematic soon for anyone who would like to buidl this themselves. 

Protoyped on an Arduino Uno with the final compiled code and wired components on a Teensy 3.2.
