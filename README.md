NeoPixel LEDs that respond to motion &amp; flow. Warning: can be addictive.

NeoPixel LEDS that have three setting (party, calm, and motion controlled) that toggles when power is cycled. The motion controlled setting uses a GY-521 MPU-6050 MPU6050 3 Axis Accelerometer Gyroscope Module with 6 DOF to sense motion and orientation in space. The LEDs currently only respond to two planes of motion. Hoping to get around to changing that sooner than later.

I also hope to upload a schematic soon for anyone who would like to build this themselves.

Prototyped on an Arduino Uno with the final compiled code and wired components on a Teensy 3.2.
