# Easy NeoPixels Library

Makes it easy to use Neopixels with just a few easy commands!

No knowledge of functions, objects, or even variables required.

## Dependencies

## Advanced Users

You probably don't want to use this, but if you do: be aware the library just *pollutes the global namespace* with a variable and a few functions.
